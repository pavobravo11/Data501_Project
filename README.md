This project, presented as part of the DATA 501 course, explores the intersection of climate action and green finance. The research focuses on analyzing the preparedness of European countries for transitioning to green finance, identifying key factors influencing this preparedness, and proposing actionable strategies for underperforming nations to meet sustainability goals by 2050.

## Motivation
![Green Finance Importance](https://github.com/pavobravo11/Data501_Project/blob/master/powerpoint/Importance%20of%20Green%20Finance.png)

## Research Questions
1. Which European countries are the most prepared for the green finance transition, and which are falling behind?
2. What factors most greatly contribute to a country's preparedness towards green financing?
3. In which areas should underprepared countries prioritize their efforts to achieve the 2050 sustainability goals?

## Methodology
### Data Aggregation:
Leveraged insights from prior research and existing indexes to assess country-level data without recreating research methods.
    Focused on scientifically driven methods and scorecards to measure specific attributes.
    Incorporated diverse data sources like:
        Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI)
        Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
        Bloomberg Terminals
        World Population Review

### Successful Methods:
1. Combined existing indexes and market data for robust analysis.
Avoided aggregation difficulties by relying on country-level data from expert-driven sources.

2. Created a scorecard to measure a countries preparedness based on these factors

## Key Results
### Research Question 1: Preparedness for Green Finance

![Finding 1](https://github.com/pavobravo11/Data501_Project/blob/master/powerpoint/RQ%20Finding%201.1.png)

#### Insight: Ranking the Highest in Climate Policy, The Netherlands has Established Itself as the European Leader in Sustainable Finance, issuing ~15% of its GDP in Sustainable Bonds

#### Insight: Due to its Lack of Climate Policy and Renewable Energy Usage, Poland is Falling far Behind in the Race for Sustainable Finance, Issuing Less Than 1% of its GDP in Green Instruments


![Finding 3](https://github.com/pavobravo11/Data501_Project/blob/master/powerpoint/RQ%20Finding%201.3.png)

#### Scorecard Results. Top Countries: Denmark, Netherlands, and Sweden. Bottom Countries: Italy, Poland, and Portugal


### Research Question 2: Contributing Factors
Key Indicators:

### Governance scores and ESG activities from MSCI.

![Indicator 1](https://github.com/pavobravo11/Data501_Project/blob/master/powerpoint/RQ%20Finding%202.2.png)


        Climate policy, renewable usage, and energy efficiency from CCPI.
        Natural disaster resilience metrics from World Population Review.
    Findings:
        Strong climate policies and renewable energy adoption drive preparedness.
        Corporate willingness and governance influence ESG initiatives.

Research Question 3: Prioritization for Underprepared Countries

    Key Areas of Focus: Climate policy and green bond market development.
    Observations:
        Countries with weaker climate policies have smaller sustainable bond markets.
        Northern European countries lead in renewable energy usage and GHG reduction.

Discussion
Lessons Learned:

    Green bonds are effective for financing sustainable projects.
    Strong government incentives are crucial for driving private-sector adoption of green finance.

Key Reflection:

    A "top-down" approach, combining governmental policy and private-sector initiatives, is the most effective strategy for driving sustainability.

Future Considerations

    Extrapolation Using Machine Learning:
        Predict performance of countries with limited data.
    Explore Relationships:
        Uncover deeper insights within existing models.
    Dashboard Development:
        Create centralized platforms to analyze results and monitor progress.
